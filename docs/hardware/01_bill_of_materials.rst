Bill of Materials
=================

This is ToddlerBot's `Bill of Materials (BOM) <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmoxJnTnUaQ_-WAAjnchBhaX5HZ4ElUV5pXksEV6GEbeEjiie1E_BdN9XCMt6FtfBaopXoaeSOeMDg/pubhtml>`_. 
This list includes all the parts needed to build the Toddlerbot. Please open a GitHub issue if you have trouble sourcing any of the parts
or finding anything missing.

Please double-check the BOM to ensure you have all the necessary tools and purchasing any missing items before you start building.

We recommend purchasing the **essentials** section first, in case any change of plan is needed.
PCB files are not included in the BOM. Please refer to the :ref:`pcb` section for more information.
